# To Do App

## We want to create a ToDo list with the following features:
    1) A form to get some data about a task: subject, description, max time to do.
    2) We can also send a voice to describe a task.
    3) We can see and check each of tasks and edit them.
    4) A person who has some tasks to do, can do tasks that don't expire.

* We can set and get data from `localStorage`.

### Please consider the following rules and features:
    1) List of tasks and the form of a task SHOULD NOT be in ONE parent.
    2) When a task is selected, the user can see it as highlighted item on the list.
    3) If a voice is playing or stopped, the user can see an icon of each states on the selected item in the list.

### Sugesstions
- You can use `Tailwind` or other css libraries.
- You can use `redux` or other state managements.

## And finally:
- Please use the current structrue of project to develop.
- Set and use the correct types in your code.
